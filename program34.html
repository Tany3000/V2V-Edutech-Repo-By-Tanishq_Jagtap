<!-- notes of javascript -->
  <!--var = it is a global variable
let= local variable
const= constant-->
<!-- var = variable - variable is a container which stores value
 variable is a name given to memory location 
 variable is loosely typed in javascript i.e datatype of variable is not defined
 variable can be declared using const,var,auto
 the var keyword use used in all javascript code from 1995 to 2015
 the let and const keywords were added to javascript in 2015.
 the var keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers. -->
 <!-- naming convention rule
  1. Names can contain letters, digits,underscores, and dollar signs.
  2. Names must begin with a letter.
  3. Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
  4. Names are also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
  5. Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names. -->
  <!-- the assignment operator 
   in javascript, the equal sign(=) is an "assignment" operaton, not an "equal to" operator -->
